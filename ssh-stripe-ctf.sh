ssh level01@ctf.stri.pe

#You can begin Stripe's CTF challenge by running ssh level01@ctf.stri.pe from your shell and entering the password e9gx26YEb2.
#Your goal is to read the contents of /home/level02/.password. In /levels/level01, you'll find a setuid binary owned by level02 (as well as its source code) â€” you will probably find it useful.
#Once you have the password, you can ssh in as level02. There are six levels in all; once you've logged in as level06 your goal is to read the password from /home/the-flag/.password.
#If you've successfully captured the flag, let us know at ctf@stripe.com! We'll send a special-edition Stripe CTF T-shirt to anyone who successfully captures the flag. Include the following information in your email:
